# CS184 Final Project â€“ BezierBox

BezierBox is a font-editing website created by [Brandon James Wong](mailto:brandonwong14@berkeley.edu), [Jonah Alex Bedouch](mailto:bedouch@berkeley.edu), [Nicolas DePalma](mailto:nicolasd@berkeley.edu), and [Richard Villagomez](mailto:richard.villagomez@berkeley.edu) as a part of CS184: Computer Graphics at UC Berkeley in Spring 2025.

This website hosts all of the reports created for submission during the project, in both web and PDF form.

The source code for this website itself is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jonahbedouch/cs184-reports), but it is a
cut down and re-themed version of [Jonah's portfolio](https://bedouch.net).
It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted with
[Vercel](https://vercel.com). The project writeups are written in Markdown,
and converted into a PDF using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) with the
[Typst](https://typst.app) render engine and a custom template. The raw markdown
is then rendered using MDX on this page to create the web version.
